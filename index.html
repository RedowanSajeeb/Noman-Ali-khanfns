            <h1>Early life</h1>
            <h2>Accusations of misconduct</h2>
            <p>Khan was born 4 May 1978, in Germany to a Pakistani family and spent his preschool years in the former
                East Berlin. His father then worked for the Pakistan Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Khan
                attended the Pakistan Embassy school from grades 2 to 8. His father moved the family to New York when
                Khan was in his teens.Six eminent Muslim clerics and academics, led by imam Mohamed Magid, began
                their own inquiry into the allegations and released a joint statement, asserting that Khan "had engaged
                in conduct unbecoming of any believer, much less someone who teaches about the Holy Qurâ€™an."
                Khan had attempted to prevent the release of the statement.</p>
